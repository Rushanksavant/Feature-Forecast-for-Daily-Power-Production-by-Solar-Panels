# The aim is to forecast following features for power produced by solar pannel:
- The daily value of the power meter on the DC to AC converter (This is the current cumulative solar power)
- The daily power consumption of the house (This value can be negative in the case that the solar power exceeds)
- The daily gas consumption of the house (Gas is only used for heating)

Still in progress..
